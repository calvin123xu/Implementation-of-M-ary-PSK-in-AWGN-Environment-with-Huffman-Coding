This report explores the implementation of M-ary Phase
Shift Keying (M-PSK) modulation in an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment with Huffman coding.
The study aims to analyze the performance of various M-PSK
schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16PSK, 32PSK, and 64PSK)
by evaluating their Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error
Rate (SER) with and without Huffman encoding. Huffman
coding is applied to compress the data before transmission,
with its impact on system performance being a key focus.
Simulations were conducted to observe the effect of different
Eb/N0 values on the performance of each modulation scheme.
Results show that higher-order PSKs experience higher sensitivity to noise and require more energy to maintain the
same BER. Additionally, Huffman coding introduces further
challenges by increasing the complexity of the system, which
leads to higher BER and SER, particularly at lower Eb/N0
values. The findings suggest that while Huffman encoding
can achieve data compression, it is not ideal for high-order
PSK schemes due to their increased sensitivity to noise. The
report concludes that for systems where source coding is
applied, low-order PSK schemes such as BPSK or QPSK are
preferable.
